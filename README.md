b2gremote
=========

A Firefox add-on to push applications to your b2g device.

First step is to enable the "Remote Debugging" option in
the Settings app on the device. On Linux, you also need
to set up the udev rules properly for ADB : See
https://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up

This add-on is currently only tested on Linux, but could work
also on Mac. No support for Windows yet.
